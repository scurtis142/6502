For compiling and installing the assembler:

cd vasm
make CPU=6502 SYNTAX=oldstyle
vasm6502_oldstyle is the assembly program



./ea-script.py                                        Run python script to make binary
hexdump -C rom.bin                                    View hexdump contents of binary
minipro -p AT28C64B -w file-to-write                  Write binary to ROM. NOTE: The other day this was working on 1 usb port but not the other
minipro -l                                            List all avaliable ROM chips for programmer
minipro -k                                            Check programmer communication
./6502-assembler -Fbin -dotdir -o hello.bin hello.s   Assemble hello.s to hello.bin binary


To use the Makefile:
make
make write
